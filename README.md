# DOGE_Project
This project was developed by extracting data from the Doge (Department of Government Efficiency) website. I employed the Pandas library to structure, organize, clean and refine the data, while using the Matplotlib library to generate the visualizations on the cleaned datasets. This project was fully built in VS Code, leveraging its integrated Jupyter notebook environment.

# Government Contracts Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes government contract data using Python, focusing on visualizing contract values across different agencies. The analysis provides insights into the distribution of contract values and helps identify patterns in government spending.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of contract information
- Visualization of contract values by agency
- Converting and displaying monetary values in millions of dollars
- Horizontal bar chart representation for better readability

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
  - matplotlib: Data visualization
  - requests: Web scraping (if applicable)

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook doge.ipynb
```

## Usage
The main analysis is contained in `doge.ipynb`. The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Cleaning of monetary values
- Agency-wise contract value aggregation
- Horizontal bar chart visualization with values in millions of dollars

## Data Source
[Add information about where the contract data comes from]
